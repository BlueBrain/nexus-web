## Deployment

You can find out how to deploy a build [in the wiki](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-web/wiki/Deploying-Your-Nexus-Web-Instance)

## Documentation

The documentation for Nexus Fusion can be found in the [product docs](https://bluebrainnexus.io/docs/fusion/index.html).

### Resource-level [Plugins](https://bluebrainnexus.io/docs/fusion/plugins.html)

A core component of Studio is the ability for data curators to develop a domain-specific presentation layer for their resources in Nexus Fusion. This allows data consumers to visualize their datasets using graphs, charts, or 3D visualizations, and to present the relevant metadata to the user.

Plugins are developed using Javascript and are loaded into the Nexus Fusion instance from the /plugins folder.

### [Studios](https://bluebrainnexus.io/docs/fusion/studio.html) Subapp

Studios space allows data curators to display their data using customisable, persistent queries. Using custom plugins developed with JavaScript, data curators can format the presentation of the query results any way they like.

### [Admin](https://bluebrainnexus.io/docs/fusion/admin.html) Subapp

The Nexus Fusion admin app allows you to manage your Nexus Delta instance.

There are several channels provided to address different issues:

- **Feature request**: If there is a feature you would like to see in this application, please first consult the [list of open feature requests](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature+label%3Afrontend+label%3Anexus-web). In case there isn't already one, please [open a feature request](https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus/issues/new?labels=feature,frontend,nexus-web) describing your feature with as much detail as possible.

## Development Tips

### When using the nexus sdk

- Never use `@id` as an absolute nexus address.
- avoid using `nexus.httpGet()`, instead, use the specific API methods available

### When building URLs inside the App

- Don't add the basePath in a URL, it will be added automatically by react-router.
